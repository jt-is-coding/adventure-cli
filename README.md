# ruby-cli-template

Hey there! This is AdventureCLI, a short (tiny, even) text adventure that allows you to create an adventurer and experience one of two different campaigns.
Upon either completion or reaching a fail condition, you'll be booted back to the start where you can either create a new adventurer, or load your most recent one.
Some say there's a secret message if you manage to complete both without exiting the app...but I'll never tell...
To get started, run ruby app.rb in the terminal!

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
